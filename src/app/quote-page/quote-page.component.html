        <h2 class="title">Save money for your business by switching water supplier</h2>

        <p class="bold body_text">
        Since 2017, UK businesses, charities and public sector organisations have been able to choose who
        supplies their water, meaning they can now avoid being locked into costly contracts.</p>
        <p class="body_text">
        If your business still hasnâ€™t switched, you could make significant savings by comparing water
        suppliers to find a better deal.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
        At Love Energy Savings, we are committed to guiding you through the process of switching water
        supplier to help you find the very best deal for your business.
